# Yuchen Fan
1. Splitting params from main in a separate parameters.py file
2. Investigate on output variation according to parameters variation
    (e.g. randomicity of mutation probability) -> convergence time discussion

# Alessandro Scarciglia | Giacomo Franchini
1. Producing a draft of presentation (problem assessment, algorithm, results)
2. Montecarlo for testing different initializations DONE
3. Plotting gaussian trend of output for 3 configs:
    3.1 100 Gen 1 Restart (assessment GA)
    3.2 100 Gen 10 Restart (assessment bob-GA)
    3.3 1000 Gen 1 Restart (assessment pushing on GA instead of bob)
